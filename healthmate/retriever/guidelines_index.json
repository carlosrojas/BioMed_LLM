This means:\n\n- Large PDFs are split into multiple searchable chunks\n- Each chunk can be retrieved independently\n- Overlap ensures context is preserved\n\n### File Naming\n\n- Use descriptive filenames (they'll appear as source names in the UI)\n- Examples: `diabetes_guidelines.pdf`, `hypertension_treatment.md`\n- Avoid special characters in filenames\n\n## Tips for Best Results\n\n1. **Quality over Quantity**: Focus on high-quality, authoritative medical sources\n2.",

This infection is commonly acquired for \nthe first time in early childhood and may reappear \nthroughout a person’s lifetime. \n \nWho gets this disease? \nAnyone can get oral herpes. \n \nHow is it spread? \nOral herpes is spread through close person- to-\nperson contact such as direct contact with saliva \nor the sores (e.g., kissing). \n \nWhat are the symptoms? \nThere are initial infections and in some people \nrecurrent sores (fluid -like blisters).  In young \nchildren the initial infections may not cause any \nsymptoms or can involve many sores within the \nmouth, on the cheeks, lips and/or gums.",

Re -infection can occur \nthroughout life. \n \nWhat are the symptoms of RSV? \nSmall infants may have irritability, decreased \nactivity and breathing difficulties as early \nsymptoms.  Older children may have symptoms \nsimilar to any other respiratory infection, such as \ncough, sneezing, fever, runny nose, wheezing, and \ndecrease in appetite. \n \nHow is RSV spread? \nRSV is spread when the infected person sneezes \nor coughs the droplets into the air.  The person \nwho is at risk then inhales the virus from the air.  \nThe infection can be spread by direct contact with \nnasal or oral secretions from the infected person.  \nActivities such as kissing the face of a child or \ncoming into c ontact with surfaces that have been \ninfected with secretions and then rubbing the eyes \nor nose can spread RSV.",

Tell them that the \ninformation is available to doctors and scientists, and also may be available on \nthe Internet. They will be doing some research into agents at a later time. \n \nAs an example, you might want to talk briefly about an agent they might be \nfamiliar with, E. coli. Some forms of the bacteria E. coli cause food poisoning. \n(You may have a news story about an example of people who got sick from \neating food that was infected with E. coli.)

Warm temperatures—for example, room temperature or \nbeing out in the sun—make the bacteria multiply quickly. High heat kills the \nbacteria. That’s why meat needs to be cooked thoroughly and hot foods need to \nbe refrigerated immediately after a meal. (For more information on food safety, \nvisit the BAM!

In the most \ncommon type of psoriasis, the skin becomes inflamed and produces red, \nthickened areas, often with silvery scales.

It has great potential for improving the lives of patients, \nwhile simultaneously easing the strain on health systems. \nWhile it is widely implemented across the WHO European Region, there are opportunities for  \nimproving delivery and outcomes. \nIn 1998, the WHO Regional Office for Europe published a working paper on therapeutic patient \neducation which served as an important resource for leaders and practitioners in the field.",

Developed \nwith a group of academics, clinicians and educators from countries throughout the WHO European \nRegion, it served to define therapeutic patient education, specify the skills that patients with chronic \ndiseases should be taught, describe the content and structure of several interventions, and identify \nareas for action. \nNow, 25 years later, there have been significant developments in the evidence base, clinical practice \nand the context in which therapeutic patient education – and broader self-management support - is \nprovided. \nWhat has also occurred in those 25 years are vast societal and demographic developments.

Adult learning is \nrelevant to both the interaction between a \npatient and health professionals and the \ndesign and delivery of training programmes \nfor health professionals.\nAdult Learning Theory suggests that learning is \nenhanced by building on an individual’s previous \nknowledge and experience (73). This approach \nmay be relevant when designing new courses, \nfor example by engaging existing patients who \nare experienced in self-management of their \ncondition in the design and content of therapeu-\ntic patient education programmes or engaging \nhealth professionals in the formulation of the \ncurriculum of training programmes for health \nprofessionals.",
